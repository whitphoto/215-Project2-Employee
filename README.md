Programming Assignment 2

Create a class called Employee that includes three instance (class) variables – a first name of type String, 
a last name of type String, and a monthly salary of type double. Provide a constructor that initializes the 
three class variables. Provide a set and get method for each of the three class variables. If the monthly 
salary is not positive, do not set its value. Write a driver for the Employee class named EmployeeDriver that 
demonstrates class Employee’s capabilities. Create two Employee objects and display each object’s yearly salary.
Then give each employee a 10% raise and display each Employee’s yearly salary again.
